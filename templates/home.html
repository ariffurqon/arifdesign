            <p>Hello there! My name is Arif Furqon. I'm a full-stack web developer fluent in client-side and server-side Javascript. I love staying on the bleeding edge of technology to assist and create beautifully engineered, genuinely useful and edgy products.</p>

       
            <p>I'm currently exploring React.js and Angular 2, also diving into the world of mobile development with React-Native. Based in Union Square, San Francisco, you will find me often at meetups or some events in the city.</p>

      
            <p>Outside programming and web development, I'm a big fan of fitness (soul-cycle/spinning, anyone?), nutrition, and a dash of men's couture. Check out my recent <a href="#/portfolio">projects</a> and
