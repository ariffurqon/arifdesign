            <p>Hello! It's me, I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet... oopsie, that was Adele :). On a serious note, my name is Arif Furqon. I'm a full-stack web developer fluent in client-side and server-side Javascript. I love staying on the bleeding edge of technology to assist and create beautifully engineered, genuinely useful and edgy products.</p>

       
            <p>I'm currently exploring React.js and Angular 2, also diving into the world of mobile development with React-Native. Based in Union Square, San Francisco, you will find me often at meetups or some events in the city.</p>
